# discordfs
🗃️ Store your files on Discord with a UI similar to Google Drive

## how does it work?

Each file that you upload on the web is split into 25MB chunks, is encrypted, and sent into a Discord channel. A list of the chunk's message IDs are stored alongside the file id so that it can be unencrypted and reconstructed when downloaded.
